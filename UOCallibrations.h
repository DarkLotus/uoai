	UOAI - Ultima Online client offset/adress callibrations, i.e. the magic of UOAI
	UOAI obtains global addresses, function pointers and struct/vtbl offsets by disassembling the client at runtime and finding points of interest.
	Disassembly is done instruction-per-instruction or function-per-function, i.e. we don't disassemble the 'whole' client only what we are interested in,
	starting from the entrypoint of the executable. See UOCallibration.c for the magic.
	The advantage of this approach is that UOAI is less sensitive to client-patches; and changes often require only small changes to the callibration code,
	which means that updates of UOAI should be easy when necessary, given the callibration code can be debugged step per step.

//PathNode structure offsets are very unlikely to change, so it makes more sense to define a struct PathNode with fixed offsets than to callibrate the fieldoffsets.
//	However, to ensure we remember where to find those offsets in case they would change after all, the callibrations were added and tested but removed from the
//	distributed assembly. The general idea is that EXTENDED_CALLBIRATIONS are unnecessary overhead, but might become usefull some day or are at least part
//	of my knowledge of offsets in the client and therefore it makes sense to collect and test that knowledge here. The number of EXTENDED_CALLBIRATIONS is currently
//	limited, but in future more might be added; if so, then I'm probably working on some new features for which require those new offsets.
