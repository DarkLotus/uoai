/*
	This code does not implement an actual x86 assembler, however it implements serialization methods for some of the
	most often used instructions. Basically i add new instructions or constructs here whenever i need them.

	Essentially these methods just write the specified instruction to a processstream.
	The current position of the stream must be the actual virtual memory address for relative jmps and calls!
	So ProcessStream or BufferedStream(ProcessStream, 4096) are ok.
